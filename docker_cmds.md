## Search Docker Hub for images
To find a certain docker image simply run the below commmand passing the image name
```
$ docker search <image-name>

example:
$ docker search redis
```

## Running a docker image
To run a certain image, use the run flag, this will run the image and might get you inside of it, so that whatever you type in the terminal is going to only affect the running image.
```
$ docker run <image-name>
```
To run the image in the background, simply add the -d option, this is similar to passing the & charecter after executing a service.
```
$ docker run -d <image-name>
```
To run the image with a certain version simply add the version after the :
```
$ docker run -d <image-name>:<image-version>

example
$ docker run -d redis:2.3
```

## Get more details about the running container

$ docker inspect 54106c6357da

$ docker inspect determined_brattain
```
